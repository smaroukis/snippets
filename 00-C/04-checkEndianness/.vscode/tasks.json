// type: Identifies the task type. Here, it's specified as cppbuild, which is commonly used for C/C++ build tasks.
// label: A human-readable string that appears in the command palette. This label is "C/C++: gcc build active file", suggesting that the task compiles the currently active file in VS Code.
// command: Specifies the path to the compiler (gcc) used to build the file. Here, it's /usr/bin/gcc.
// args: These are the command line arguments passed to gcc:
// 	-fdiagnostics-color=always: Forces the compiler to use colored output for errors and warnings.
// 	-g: Includes debugging information in the compiled output, which helps with debugging.
// 	${file}: This is a variable that represents the path of the currently active file in VS Code.
// 	-o: Specifies the output file name.
// 	${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}: Sets the output file in the same directory as the source file but without an extension.
// options: Specifies options for how the task is run:
// 	cwd: "Current Working Directory" where the command is run. ${fileDirname} means the directory of the currently active file.
// problemMatcher: Used to parse the compiler output for errors and warnings and integrate them into the editor. $gcc is a predefined problem matcher for GCC that captures common error and warning formats.
// group: Defines how the task is categorized in the user interface:
// 	kind: This is a "build" task, meant to compile or prepare your project.
// 	isDefault: When set to true, this task will run when you execute the "Run Build Task" command without specifying a particular task.
// detail: Additional information about the task, here noting the specific compiler used (/usr/bin/gcc).
